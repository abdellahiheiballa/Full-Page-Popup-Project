## Project Overview

This project is a response to the front-end developer position test at INFINITE8. The goal was to design two celebration pop-ups with animations to be triggered when users reach specific milestones on the website. 

### Task Requirements

1. **Pop-Up 1: Full-Page Celebration with XP Bar**
   - A full-page pop-up celebrating user level-ups.
   - Features an animation of an XP bar filling up.
   - Introduces a new badge with smooth animations.
   - Fully responsive and immersive experience across all devices.

2. **Pop-Up 2: Compact Celebration for Rewards**
   - A smaller pop-up showing rewards earned by the user.
   - Focuses on animations highlighting unlocked rewards without an XP bar.
   - Provides a quick, engaging celebration moment while being fully responsive.

### Technical Requirements
- Built using **Next.js**, the framework of choice for INFINITE8.
- Utilizes open-source libraries for enhancing user experience.
- Clean, well-structured, and scalable codebase.
- Fully responsive design for both web and mobile platforms.

## Tools Used
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth animations.
- **Styling**: Chakra UI for responsive design.
- **Graphics**: Hand-drawn GIFs created using Adobe Photoshop animation tools.

## Development Approach

The development of the pop-ups followed best practices, ensuring high performance and maintainability:

- **Responsive Design**: The pop-ups were designed to adjust smoothly across various screen sizes and devices.
- **Clean Code Structure**: The code was organized in a modular fashion, with clear separation between components, making it easier to maintain and extend.
- **Manual Animation Creation**: All icons and GIF animations were hand-drawn by me using Photoshop, ensuring a unique and artistic touch.
